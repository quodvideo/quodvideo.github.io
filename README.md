# quodvideo.github.io

This isn't really a project. It's just some things I put here to easily show them to people.

[Mono](quodvideo.github.io/mono/xms.xhtml) is something I used for [CAMD](http://www.lsu.edu/camd/)'s open house a few times.

Most of other stuff is musing about what I want a desktop environment to look and work like.
